# _Data Execution Protection_ {#data-execution-protection}

Stack smash attacks may inject code. The other possible way to prevent such an attack is to prevent malicious code from executing. Some modern OSâ€™s already have Data Execution Protection (DEP) support [[DEP](http://media.blackhat.com/bh-us-12/Briefings/M_Miller/BH_US_12_Miller_Exploit_Mitigation_Slides.pdf )] <sup>[[1]](#footnote1)</sup> [[PaX](/ https://pax.grsecurity.net/)] <sup>[[2]](#footnote2)</sup>. DEP may be applied to: [[WindowsInternal](https://www.amazon.com/Windows-Internals-Part-Developer-Reference/dp/0735648735 )]<sup>[[3]](#footnote3)</sup>  

*   User mode stacks
*   User mode pages not specifically marked as executable
*   Kernel mode Stacks
*   kernel paged pool (X64)
*   kernel session pool (X64)

Research shows 14 of 19 exploits from popular exploit kits fail with DEP enabled. [[DEP](http://media.blackhat.com/bh-us-12/Briefings/M_Miller/BH_US_12_Miller_Exploit_Mitigation_Slides.pdf )] <sup>[[1]](#footnote1)</sup>.
