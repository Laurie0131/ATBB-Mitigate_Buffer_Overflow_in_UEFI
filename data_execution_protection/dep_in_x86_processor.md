## DEP in X86 Processor {#dep-in-x86-processor}

DEP is a hardware feature. Intel X86 processor supports the XD (eXecution Disable) bit in the page table. [IA32SDM] This XD bit can be used to indicate that a page is an Execute-Disable Page. In order to enable Data Execution Protection, the operating system needs to set the IA32_EFER.NXE (No-eXecution Enable) bit in IA32_EFER MSR, and then set the XD bit in the CPU PAE page table.
